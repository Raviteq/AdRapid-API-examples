# AdRapid API examples
This repository contains a list of demos / example implementations of the AdRapid API. 

The `simple` implementation illustrates in a simple way the whole process of getting a list of available templates, getting rules for a specific template, sending an order, as well as wating for and displaying the resulting ads. A log displays the data that is sent to and from the API through the order process. http://test.adrapid.com/api-test/simple/index.html

The `multiple` implementation is an example on how multiple orders for different templates can be sent at the same time. http://test.adrapid.com/api-test/multiple/index.html

More examples will be added shortly.

A simple wrapper found in [AdRapid.js](assets/adrapid.js) is used for the demo implementations. Some frontend helper methods are provided.

Documentation for the API is available at http://raviteq.github.io/adrapid-api/
